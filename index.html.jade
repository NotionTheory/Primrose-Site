          p Primrose VR democratizes access to what experts and enthusiasts alike are calling "The Last Medium", aka Virtual Reality. Smartphones changed the world by providing people with constant access to applications that fit their on-the-go lifestyle, untethered from their desks. Virtual Reality will change the world by providing people with constant access to natural-feeling, face-to-face collaboration with anyone in the world.

          p The Primrose Framework helps web developers create virtual reality experiences within standard web browsers on desktop and mobile devices alike. Through its common interaction space, design tools, interface objects, and user experience best-practices, users and developers collaborate to create interactive multimedia and productivity applications.

          p Primrose is free, open source software (#[a(href="https://github.com/capnmidnight/Primrose/blob/master/LICENSE.md", target="_blank") GPLv3]) and may readily be
            used with other #[a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software", target="_blank") FOSS] projects.

        p: aside NOTE: This is still an early beta release, with bugs of both the known and unknown variety. In particular, I have no way of testing whether or not the international keyboard support is correct. I'll also be making major breaking changes over the near future as I build new features, delete old ideas, and move code around to whatever place makes the best sense.
